__Briefly About Myself:__

My name is Kalashnikov Maxim, I am 23 years old, I am a novice JavaScript developer, I am constantly improving and developing in this direction and at the moment I consider my achievements:

* The ability to write JavaScript code at the basic level;
* Understanding in ES6;
* HTML/CSS Basics
* Understanding basic code-writing algorithms and principles of object-oriented programming.

I am in a constant stream of learning new information to improve my skills, I am easily taught, motivated, self-organized, I am in the process of learning English.
Since I am a beginner, I need a little support in developing my skills in teamwork and working with real practical tasks.
